# MSTCityGraph - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) between Cities**

This project generates a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** between a set of cities, providing the most cost-effective way to connect them. It uses **Graph Theory** and popular algorithms to create an optimal road, power, or communication network. The system draws the graph and visualizes the MST in an interactive manner, displaying the graph before and after the MST is generated along with the MST edges.

## **Overview**

This system provides a way to generate and visualize the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) between cities. After entering cities and the distances between them, the app will display:

1. The graph of cities **before** the MST.
2. The graph **after** the MST is applied.
3. The **MST edges** (the roads or connections selected by the MST algorithm).

This project can be applied to real-world problems such as road network design, power grid optimization, or travel route planning, where minimizing the total connection cost is crucial.

## Workflow

![Workflow](screenshots/Workflow.png)

This diagram outlines the step-by-step process involved in constructing the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a set of cities:

1. **Collect city data**: Users input city names, which are geocoded into coordinates.
2. **Preprocess data**: Clean and structure the data for graph creation.
3. **Graph construction**: A weighted graph is formed where cities are nodes and distances are edge weights.
4. **Apply MST algorithms**: Algorithms like Prim‚Äôs or Kruskal‚Äôs are used to compute the MST.
5. **Generate MST**: Extract the optimal edges that form the MST.
6. **Visualize MST**: Before and after comparison to show the impact of the MST.

## MST Visualization: Comparative Study

This section provides a visual and analytical comparison of the Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) generated using **Prim‚Äôs Algorithm** and **Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm**. The graphs below show the city network **before and after** applying each algorithm.

### Using Prim‚Äôs Algorithm

| Before MST & After MST                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Prim's Before & After](screenshots/prims.png) |

**Observation:**
Prim‚Äôs algorithm starts with an arbitrary node and grows the MST by adding the minimum weight edge connected to the current tree. This tends to produce a more locally optimized structure when node distribution is dense or clustered.

### Using Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm

| Before MST & After MST                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Kruskal's Before](screenshots/kruskals.png) |

**Observation:**
Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm sorts all edges by weight and adds them in order, avoiding cycles. It can handle disconnected graphs initially and is more efficient when edges are already sorted. It results in globally optimal edges regardless of starting point.

### Comparative Summary

| Criteria                    | Prim‚Äôs Algorithm                       | Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Approach                    | Greedy, grows MST from a single vertex | Greedy, adds edges by weight globally       |
| Graph Requirement           | Connected graph                        | Can work with disconnected graphs initially |
| Edge Selection              | Based on adjacent nodes to tree        | Based on globally minimum weight edges      |
| Performance on Dense Graphs | Performs well                          | Slightly slower due to edge sorting         |
| Use Case                    | Suitable for dense graphs              | Suitable for sparse graphs                  |

### üì¶ **Logistics & Delivery Route Planning**

* **Use**: Design efficient depot-to-city connections to reduce transportation costs.
* **Example**: A delivery company connects all cities it serves from a central depot using the MST structure.
