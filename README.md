# MSTCityGraph - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) between Cities**

This project generates a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** between a set of cities, providing the most cost-effective way to connect them. It uses **Graph Theory** and popular algorithms to create an optimal road, power, or communication network. The system draws the graph and visualizes the MST in an interactive manner, displaying the graph before and after the MST is generated along with the MST edges.

## **Overview**

This system provides a way to generate and visualize the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) between cities. After entering cities and the distances between them, the app will display:

1. The graph of cities **before** the MST.
2. The graph **after** the MST is applied.
3. The **MST edges** (the roads or connections selected by the MST algorithm).

This project can be applied to real-world problems such as road network design, power grid optimization, or travel route planning, where minimizing the total connection cost is crucial.

## **How to Use**

1. **Enter Cities**:

   * On the homepage, you will be prompted to enter the **cities** separated by commas (e.g., City A, City B, City C).

2. **Generate the MST**:

   * After entering the cities, click on the **"Generate MST"** button.
   * The application will:

     * Display the **graph before MST**: Showing all cities connected by their respective distances.
     * Display the **graph after MST**: Showing only the roads selected by the MST algorithm.
     * List the **MST edges**: These are the edges that make up the minimum spanning tree.

4. **Interactive Visualization**:

   * The graphs will be drawn using **Matplotlib** or another visualization tool, displaying the nodes (cities) and edges (connections) clearly.
   * The MST will be highlighted in the graph, showing how the algorithm connects the cities with minimal cost.

5. **Applications**:

   * The result of the MST can be used for various practical applications like road network design, power grid optimization, delivery route planning, and more.

## **Real-World Applications**

Here are several practical uses of the MST-based system:

### üöó **Road Network Design**

* **Use**: Design cost-effective road or railway networks that connect all cities with minimal total construction cost.
* **Why MST?**: The MST connects all cities with the shortest total path **without creating cycles**, minimizing infrastructure cost.

### üåê **Telecommunication & Power Grids**

* **Use**: Laying out cables (fiber optic, telephone, electricity) between locations.
* **Why MST?**: The MST ensures full connectivity with minimal wiring cost and no redundancy.

### üó∫Ô∏è **Map Applications (like Google Maps)**

* **Use**: Simplify maps by identifying the backbone routes connecting all cities efficiently.
* **Note**: MST does not find the shortest path between two cities but finds the **most efficient way to connect all cities** overall.

### üì¶ **Logistics & Delivery Route Planning**

* **Use**: Design efficient depot-to-city connections to reduce transportation costs.
* **Example**: A delivery company connects all cities it serves from a central depot using the MST structure.

### üß≠ **Travel Route Planning**

* **Use**: Suggest a cost-efficient travel path for visiting multiple cities.
* **MST as Base**: It can serve as a starting point for solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** approximately.

### üèôÔ∏è **Urban Planning & Infrastructure**

* **Use**: Plan water pipelines, sewage systems, or metro routes to minimize infrastructure costs.
* **Why MST?**: Reduces costs by connecting areas with the fewest possible connections.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Network Design in IT (LAN/WAN)**

* **Use**: Connect computers, data centers, or servers in the most efficient way to reduce cabling costs.
* **Why MST?**: MST optimizes the network topology, reducing the total cabling needed.
